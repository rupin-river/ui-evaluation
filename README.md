# UI Developer Technical Evaluation

Help us evaluate your ability to contribute to the development of the Mist web-based front end.

You may not be familiar with some of the concepts required for this evaluation (Github usage, React.js framework, etc) - feel free to use online resources to learn & discover the best way to answer each question. We do request that you not ask other people to answer the questions for you.

### How to Submit the Evaluation

Please fork this repository, add your answers directly in this README file, include any separate source files needed, and submit a pull request when you are done.

### JS Questions

#### 1.
Implement a JavaScript function "convertObject()" with this functionality:
- accepts a single parameter "obj" which is a plain JavaScript object having 0 or more properties
- all properties of "obj" will have values which are strings or numbers or null
- convertObject should return an array, where each element is the value of one of the properties of "obj"
- do not include any "obj" properties with null values, empty string values, or whitespace-only values
- convert any "obj" number values to strings before inserting into the array
- sort elements of the array in case-insensitive alphabetical order
- return the array

Usage example:
```
convertObject({ a: 'hello', b: 'Everyone', c: 53, d: ' ', e: null });
// returns [ '53', 'Everyone', 'hello' ]
```
